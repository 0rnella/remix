# Build Better Websites

Remix crosses the center of the web stack by upgrading your HTML to a speedy, client side web app with the resilience and simplicity of traditional server rendered HTML. It polyfills your server with Web Standard IO, allowing you to deploy anywhere with knowledge that transfers to any web project. Finally, it creates seamless full stack development by creating an automatic API for your views with co-located client and server code. The result is a modern, robust user experience with APIs and conventions your whole team can get behind.
