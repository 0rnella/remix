# Introduction

This book is a set of guides and topics intended to be read in order. It gives you a linear path to Remix mastery instead of bouncing around from one doc to another. While useful independently, chapters usually refer to code and concepts from previous chapters.

If your team has decided to use Remix, we think it's worth everybody's time to spend a day reading this from top to bottom. Oh, and thank you 🙏. Please let us know what you build!
